Hours worked: 25

Tasks accomplished: Deciding on the idea, completing the initialization document, meeting the first and second milestones, 
starting and completing the First Sprint, designed and began implementation of the basic menus

Lessons learnt:
-Enforce more consistent meetings
-Engage more with the other members so that their skills would be put to better use, and thus time can be freed up to do what I'm decent at, straight coding
-Whilst in the middle of my work, keep the group posted on what I intend to achieve so they can offer assistance 

Experiences: 
I have found that Unity is a remarkably similar program to others like NetBeans and Android Studio in the manner of utilizing its tool bars to add objects into 
There were a few hiccups to start with in regards to setting it up to use Visual Studio Code and certain awkward fumblings with the toolbar when adjusting the scene view, 
but afterwards it has been rather enjoyable interacting with the coding process. It is certainly less annoying than the necessary documentation, though I suspect that taking the
documentation more seriously would apply a greater degree of cohesion and structure within the process, which is duly needed.  

It is rather difficult being in the leader position. I am uncomfortable with being the one that has to bring everyone to speed on the project multiple times 
and delegating work effectively. There have been a few times that I have attempted to take on the brunt of the workload related to certain tasks by pure habit
to the chagrin of the other members. This, in addition to poor working habits and scheduling, has led to personally unsatisfactory work on my end that
the others have had to fix and adjust.
