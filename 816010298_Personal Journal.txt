Contributions Made to the Project.
-	Contributed in deciding what the main topic of the project would be.
-	Constantly communicating with group members regarding the project.
-	Aided in the completion of a project specification document. 

Experiences (Good).
-	Every member of this team is extremely hard-working and is always ready to contribute.
Experiences (Bad).
-	The communication of the ideas and essential information regarding this project to all the group members has been poor. So far, it took too long for all the
        members to become up to speed with where the project was and what needed to be done. This is despite having an active whatsApp group.
-	Scheduled group meetings didn’t take place because too many group members including the members that needed to inform the other members didn’t show up.
-	A key group member failed to show up for a group meeting concerning deliverable 2 and later announced that he do the entire milestone by himself.
        This disconnected me and other group members from the project.
-	The group is now down to 4 members. Jared is currently unavailable.


Log
	Day 1- Conversed with the other group members in coming up with a suitable topic for the project (1 hour.)
	Worked on the Project Specification Document (30 minutes)
Lesson Learnt: The group must begin to communicate more efficiently and effectively in order for this project to be a success. I must also increase my own productivity levels and
               become more invested in the project.
